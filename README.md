# SQL Server Utility

Welcome to the SQL Server Utility Repository! This repository is a collection of SQL Server scripts and utilities that I've developed and refined in last decades.

## Contents
This repository includes:

**Administration Scripts:** Scripts for monitoring, backup, recovery, security, and automation.
**Performance Tuning:** Indexing strategies, query optimization, and execution plan analysis.
**Data Warehousing:** ETL processes, data transformation, and reporting solutions.
**Development Utilities:** Functions, stored procedures, and dynamic SQL for various development needs.
**Miscellaneous:** Useful scripts that don't fit into a single category but have been essential in my career.
