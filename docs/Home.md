Welcome to the **Schema Z**, a collection of SQL Server scripts and utilities. This library is not designed to solve every challenge you may encounter, but it aims to simplify specific scenarios, such as automated partition management, ETL processes, and many others. 

This is an on-going project, and we are committed to enhancing its functionality and expanding coverage to address more common use cases for both developers and DBAs.

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're adding new utilities, enhancing existing ones, or reporting issues, your import is invaluebble and greatly appreciated. Together, we can make **Schema Z** more useful for everyone.
